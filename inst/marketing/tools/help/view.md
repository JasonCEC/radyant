## Math

Alternatively, math can be written on its own line:

$$y_t = \alpha + \beta X + \epsilon_t$$

An inline version looks like this: $y_t = \alpha + \beta X + \epsilon_t$

## Text basics
this is *italic* and this is **bold** .  another _italic_ and another __bold__ and this is `important` text.

## Indentation
> Here is some indented text
>> even more indented

## Titles
# Big title (h1)
## Middle title (h2)
### Smaller title (h3)
#### and so on (hX)
##### and so on (hX)
###### and so on (hX)

## Example lists (1)

 - bullets can be `-`, `+`, or `*`
 - bullet list 1
 - bullet list 2
    - sub item 1
    - sub item 2

        with indented text inside

 - bullet list 3
 + bullet list 4
 * bullet list 5

## Links

This is an [example inline link](http://lmgtfy.com/) and [another one with a title](http://lmgtfy.com/ "Hello, world").

Links can also be reference based : [reference 1][ref1] or [reference 2 with title][ref2].

References are usually placed at the bottom of the document

## Images

A sample image :

![revolunet logo](http://www.revolunet.com/static/parisjs8/img/logo-revolunet-carre.jpg "revolunet logo")

As links, images can also use references instead of inline links :

![revolunet logo][revolunet-logo]


## Code

It's quite easy to show code in markdown files.

Backticks can be used to `highlight` some words.

Also, any indented block is considered a code block.
